# **ADs IMPLEMENTATION - ANDROID**  
This Android application demonstrates the implementation of various types of Google AdMob ads. The app consists of five buttons, each triggering a specific type of ad using AdMob's test ad IDs.

---

## **Features**  
The app showcases the following types of ads:  

1. **Banner Ad**  
   - A rectangular ad displayed at the top or bottom of the screen.  
2. **Interstitial Ad**  
   - A full-screen ad displayed at natural transition points in the app.  
3. **Rewarded Ad**  
   - An ad that rewards users with in-app items for watching it completely.  
4. **Rewarded Interstitial Ad**  
   - Combines the interstitial ad's full-screen format with the rewarded ad's benefits.  
5. **Native Ad**  
   - An ad that matches the app's look and feel, blending seamlessly into the UI.

  On clicking, the app loads and shows an interstitial ad at an appropriate point.  

- **Button 3: Rewarded Ad**  
  On clicking, the app displays a rewarded ad and grants a reward after successful completion.  

- **Button 4: Rewarded Interstitial Ad**  
  On clicking, the app shows a rewarded interstitial ad, offering rewards while maintaining the interstitial experience.  

- **Button 5: Native Ad**  
  On clicking, the app displays a native ad that blends into the appâ€™s UI.
